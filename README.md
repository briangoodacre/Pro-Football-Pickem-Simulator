My family does **Yahoo's Pro Football Pickem fantasy game**, where you select the winning and losing NFL teams each week. We do not pick against the spread and we drop the two lowest weeks.

I hacked together a simulator that takes a probability of picking a single game correct (set at 60%) and simulates the entire season, for each player, including playoffs and tiebreakers. This is done 1 million times and each player receives their probability of winning, given their previous weeks.

This was a night and a morning hack so the code is sloppy!
